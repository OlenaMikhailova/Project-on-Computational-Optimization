    \item \textbf{Problem 1}
    
    {\fontsize{12}{14}\selectfont Prove that a strongly convex function has a unique minimum.}
    
    \item \textbf{Solution 1}
    
	Since $f$ is continuous on the compact interval $[a,b]$, by the extreme value theorem, $f$ attains its minimum at some point $x_0 \in [a,b]$. That is,
\[
f(x_0) \leq f(x) \quad \forall x \in [a,b].
\]

Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists another point $x_1 \in [a,b]$, with $x_0 \neq x_1$, such that $f(x_0) = f(x_1)$, i.e., $x_0$ and $x_1$ are both global minima.

Since $f$ is strictly convex, for any $t \in (0,1)$, the combination $x_t = t x_0 + (1-t) x_1$ satisfies:
\[
f(x_t) < t f(x_0) + (1-t) f(x_1).
\]
Substituting $f(x_0) = f(x_1)$, we get:
\[
f(x_t) < t f(x_0) + (1-t) f(x_0) = f(x_0).
\]
This contradicts the assumption that $f(x_0)$ is a global minimum, as it implies the existence of a point $x_t$ where $f(x_t) < f(x_0)$.

Thus, our assumption that $f$ has more than one global minimum must be false, meaning that $f$ has a unique global minimum. 
  
    
    \item \textbf{Problem 2}
    
    {\fontsize{12}{14}\selectfont Prove that if the gradient of a convex function is zero at a point, then that point is a minimum. Also, show that this does not necessarily hold for a non-convex function.}
    
    \item \textbf{Solution 2}
